## üîß **TECHNICAL DECISIONS**

### **Why This Priority Order?**

1. **AI Question Generation First**: This is the core value proposition that differentiates AdaptiLearn from basic quiz platforms.

2. **Content Analysis Second**: Essential for automating the question generation process from user-uploaded syllabi.

3. **API Gateway Third**: Provides the foundation for secure, scalable service architecture.

4. **Chatbot Fourth**: High engagement feature but not essential for MVP functionality.

5. **Analytics Fifth**: Enhances user experience but core analytics already exist in frontend.

6. **External APIs Sixth**: Nice-to-have feature that expands content without being essential.

7. **Real-time Features Last**: Complex implementation with moderate business impact for initial users.

### **Risk Mitigation**:

- **Fallback Strategy**: All backend features have frontend fallbacks to Firebase/mock data
- **Incremental Deployment**: Each service can be deployed independently
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Frontend works without backend, backend adds value when available
