# Branch-Specific Subjects Test

## Testing the fixed branch mapping

### CSE Branch:
- Data Structures  
- Algorithms
- Database Systems
- Operating Systems

### MECH Branch:
- Thermodynamics
- Fluid Mechanics 
- Manufacturing Processes
- Machine Design

### ECE Branch:
- Digital Electronics
- Signal Processing
- Communication Systems
- Microprocessors

### CIVIL Branch:
- Structural Analysis
- Construction Management

- Environmental Engineering

## API Endpoints:
- GET /api/analytics/performance?branch=MECH&semester=3
- GET /api/recommendations?branch=MECH&semester=3

## Frontend Changes:
- Dashboard.js now fetches data based on userProfile.branch.code
- No more hardcoded CSE subjects
- Dynamic recommendations based on branch

## Result:
✅ Mechanical Engineering students now see their relevant subjects!
✅ Each branch gets appropriate performance analytics
✅ Recommendations are branch-specific
